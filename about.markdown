I'm a BYU statistics student who hopes to go into data analytics and eventually data science.  I had a summer 2022 internship at SelectQuote where I worked for the recruiting department to find ways to lower attrition rate of salespeople.  I have a summer 2023 internship lined up as a data analyst intern for AT&T in Dallas.  I hope to be able to continue to refine my data science skills.
